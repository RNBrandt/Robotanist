<P>
This working conference was the first international joint meeting of 
linguists, anthropologists, ethnobiologists, cognitive psychologists, 
cultural geographers, economists, biologists, ecologists, natural 
resource conservationists and managers, and indigenous rights advocates 
to discuss the interrelated threats faced by the linguistic/cultural and 
biological diversity of the planet.  The goal was to identify a common 
framework and to formulate integrated plans for systematic research, 
training, and action aimed at addressing urgent preservation and 
promotion needs in this biocultural sphere.  A special focus was on the 
role of traditional environmental knowledge and the languages in which it 
is encoded in the conservation of the world's ecosystems and the 
maintenance of sustainable human-environment interactions.<P>

In their respective fields, these various communities of researchers and 
activists have called attention to the effects of rapidly occurring 
global processes of socioeconomic and ecological change on the very 
objects of their concerns: human cultural and linguistic groups and their 
traditional knowledge; biological species; and the world's environments.  
An ever growing body of literature on endangered languages, vanishing 
cultures, and biodiversity loss has been accumulating in recent years, 
attesting to the perceived gravity and urgency of such issues.  
Underlying this concern is a common interest in the future of humanity 
and the earth's ecosystems.  However, communication among all of these 
research and advocacy communities, while highly desirable and indeed 
necessary in this context, has been slow in developing. <P>

Given the comparable magnitude and exponential increase of the threat 
faced by human groups, their languages and cultures, on the one hand, and 
the world's biodiversity, on the other; and given the complexity of human 
environment interrelationships on earth, an effective and sustained 
exchange of information is crucial at this time among these intellectual 
communities.  In particular, strong evidence has emerged of remarkable 
overlaps between areas of greatest biological and greatest 
linguistic/cultural diversity around the world.  These striking 
correlations require close examination and must be accounted for.  Issues 
of human/environment coevolution may be involved, and if so, the 
foreseeable consequences of massive disruption of such long-standing 
interactions need to be addressed.  We do not have the key to what holds 
the web of life together.  Drastic change, if not outright loss, in one 
place in the web can (and demonstrably does) trigger chain effects of 
often unmeasurable proportions throughout the system.  <P>

From this perspective, loss of linguistic/cultural diversity, with its 
frequent corollary of loss of traditional knowledge, is just as much a 
part of overall ecological processes as the negative changes affecting 
biodiversity.  And loss of environmental knowledge is clearly most 
damaging in this connection.  Most of the time, these phenomena affect 
human groups inhabiting areas whose biodiversity is still poorly known to 
science, while local people have consistently been shown to possess 
detailed and accurate traditional knowledge of their ecological niches 
and ways to manage them sustainably.  This knowledge represents a capital 
and indispensable resource for any effort to preserve biodiversity and 
promote sustainability, both locally and globally.  However, it is at 
high risk of being rapidly lost as global socioeconomic factors disrupt 
traditional ways of life, promoting poverty, population growth, and 
overexploitation of the environment by both local groups and outside 
forces.  External pressures commonly promote tensions and conflicts over 
local peoples' land rights and impinge on these peoples' human, including 
cultural and linguistic, rights.  They also foster change in perceptions 
and attitudes on the part of local peoples, often leading to the 
disvaluing and abandonment of traditional knowledge and behaviors and of 
the languages that are the repositories and means of transmission of such 
knowledge.  A better understanding of the social and cognitive factors 
involved in such processes, and devising ways of preserving these human 
resources to ensure sustainability, are therefore crucial goals for any 
program for biocultural diversity maintenance.  The distinct lines of 
thinking, research, and action that have been pursued on the threats 
faced by linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity thus need to be 
decisively brought together within a common framework to adequately 
address these global challenges.  <P>

To this purpose, selected representatives of the fields mentioned above 
convened in Berkeley, California, in October 1996.  Participants in this 
three-day intensive workshop are among the major senior and junior 
experts in their respective domains who have done work relevant to the 
issues in question in a variety of the areas of greatest 
linguistic/cultural and biological diversity -- from the Americas to 
Oceania to Southeast Asia to Africa.  They included experts who are 
natives of such areas and have been involved in biocultural maintenance 
and promotion activities at both the local and global level.  These 
people combined their intellectual resources to set forth common avenues 
for research, training, and action.  To foster fruitful interaction, a 
considerable amount of preparation was done prior to the conference to 
establish common ground.  A position paper and a set of interdisciplinary 
readings were prepared and distributed by the organizer.  Participants 
also had an opportunity to suggest questions that they considered should 
be addressed at the conference, and these questions were circulated ahead 
of time.  Also precirculated were the participants' biographical 
sketches, the abstracts of presentations, and the texts of the 
introductory papers delivered at the conference, focusing on the main 
issues and perspectives in the relevant fields.  A draft of a "white 
paper", containing recommendations for integrated research and applied 
work in biocultural diversity conservation, were prepared by the 
organizer, that were discussed and revised at the conference.   <P>

At the conference, the introductory papers were delivered, followed by 
commentary by a panel of discussants; papers dealing with specific 
topics, case studies, and cross-disciplinary interconnections were also 
be presented.  Ensuing discussion focused on the issues that have been 
raised prior to the conference and by the presentation.  A sample of the 
questions addressed follows: 1) Can evolutionary theory provide a 
substantive (i.e., not merely formal or metaphorical) framework for 
understanding language/culture diversity and diversification, as it does 
for biological (including human) diversity and diversification?  2) If 
so, what may be the foreseeable consequences of the current rapid and 
drastic loss of linguistic and cultural diversity around the world?  3) 
What solid evidence do we have of human-environment symbiotic 
relationships, and of the consequences of disruption of such 
relationships?  4) What role does traditional ecological knowledge have 
in the maintenance of such relationships (or the loss thereof in their 
disruption)?  5) What role does language have in the acquisition, 
accumulation, maintenance, and transmission of this knowledge, and how 
does language loss affect these processes?  6) What are the cognitive 
underpinnings of attrition due to contact between different linguistic 
and cultural models, as well as knowledge systems, and how do they affect 
individual and societal choices and decision-making (with special 
reference to activities affecting the environment)?  7) What 
socioeconomic phenomena underlie processes of language/culture shift and 
changes in ecological knowledge and behavior?  8) How can our 
understanding of these issues best inform systematic studies of 
ecological knowledge change/loss as well as action aimed at biocultural 
diversity maintenance and promotion?  9) How can it best be made 
available to local communities as a tool for informed decision making, 
and how can it best be used to educate the general public on the global 
threats to linguistic and cultural diversity and their relationships to 
ecosystem endangerment?<P>

Participants were asked what we know on these issues; what we need to 
know; how we may proceed to find out about what we need to know; and how 
this knowledge may be applied most fruitfully toward solving problems in 
biocultural diversity preservation.  Recommendations for research and 
action were drafted jointly by these specialists, included in the "white 
paper", a final version of which is to be included in the publication 
that will result from the conference.  Based on the experience derived 
from the conference, participants also outlined a basic interdisciplinary 
curriculum for later implementation in academic and other training 
contexts (of which curriculum the conference reader may become an 
element).<P>

It is also expected that this meeting will foster working relationships 
between the experts involved and others, as well as students and other 
trainees--also thanks to the publications and training curriculum that 
emerged from this event--thus spreading the conference's perspective 
broadly.  Most importantly, the conference outlined a common framework 
for dealing with some of the most urgent problems facing science and 
policy on the verge of the 21st century: helping preserve biodiversity 
and maintain and develop the human wealth represented by indigenous 
languages and cultures and the environmental (and other) knowledge they 
embody, for the benefit of local linguistic/cultural communities, 
humanity at large, and the world's ecosystems.<P>

While the conference itself, was a working conference, not open to the 
general public, a public symposium by the same title was held on 
Saturday, October 26 at 7:30 pm in the Auditorium of the Valley Life 
Sciences Building (rm. 2050) on the Berkeley Campus.  This symposium was 
attended by conference participants and featured some of them as guest 
speakers.  A reception  followed at which it was possible to interact 
with the participants.  An exhibit of the participants' books, research 
projects, and organizations was also set up outside the Auditorium.<P>
